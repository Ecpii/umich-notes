| X (topic) |     | Y (noun) |     | か   | Meaning              |
| --------- | --- | -------- | --- | --- | -------------------- |
| たなかさん     | は   | がくせい     | です  | か   | Is Takana a student? |
か at the end of a sentence turns it into a yes-no question.

| X (topic) |     | Y (Question word) |     |     | Meaning                    |
| --------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | -------------------------- |
| ジャンさんのしごと | は   | なん                | です  | か   | What is Jean's occupation? |
You can use a question word in the position of Y to create who/what/when/where/why/how questions. The question word will differ based on what is being asked about.

> アイさんのにほんごのせんせいはだれですか。
> Who is Ai's Japanese teacher?

> しゅっしんはどこですか。
> Where is your hometown?

> だいがくはどこですか。
> Which university do you go to?

*Notice that for a school, company, sports team, etc. you use どこ rather than なん.*

なん is a form of なに used before the `d`, `t`, and `n` sounds, as well as before counters.

> なんさい、なんばん、なんねんせい
> how old, what number, what year in school

In casual speech, か is dropped and the end of the sentence is pronounced with rising intonation.
