Multi cycle CPUs will yield better performance compared to single cycle CPUs because you're not limited to setting the clock speed to the speed of the slowest instruction. Longer instructions will take multiple cycles, and shorter instructions will finish in fewer cycles. 

You can kind of think of a multi cycle CPU as a state machine.
