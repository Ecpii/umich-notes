Hello ðŸ‘‹!

I'll be keeping what limited notes I take for my classes at UMich here. I don't honestly take that many, and this repository is more for myself to sync notes between my PC and my laptop (for the rare times I go to lecture), but if you're interested maybe this could be useful to you. Or, by some misfortune of SEO, you find one of these files trying to look for answers to a problem.

# Setup
This folder is structured as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, but it's honestly nothing other than a couple of markdown files that are in the same folders. I don't actually know how to "use" Obsidian, I've just been using it as a clean way to use vim on plaintext.
