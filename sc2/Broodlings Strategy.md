# Build Order
- depot
- rax -> make this scv go to natural after 
- gas *instant after rax start*
- reaper
- orbital
- cc
- depot
- marine
- factory
- reactor on barracks
- 2nd gas
- @100% cc another orbital
- @100% factory tech lab and star port
- @100% reactor make marines
- @100% starport tech lab
- @100% tech lab on factory, make tanks
- @100% starport make 2 banshees
Now it gets improvy but
- 3rd cc
- 3rd and 4th gas
- 2 more factories
- 2 armories for upgrades
- 2 factories for each base
- on 5th factory, build ghosts (against protoss)
# Defense
Mech is very defensive and powerful but only if you plug all of your weaknesses, in order to do that, try these small tips - 3 siege tanks sieged up **ALWAYS** per base. Hug the tanks to the base and use turrets if you have money - Sensor Towers near fringe bases.
Sensor towers are broken and let you see the enemy coming a mileee away. Good to make a lot of to cover your tracks - Have your army mainly move around ur bases until its time to push out

# Macro
These tips will generally keep u defensively out there Macro (The forever checklist): When macroing, I like to imagine that I am forever going through a checklist. For each moment I have, I will build these things by going through a series of questions that depend on the priority
- Am I going to be supply blocked? -> build 1-2 supply depots (start building 2 once your build order ends)
- Am I building workers? -> build workers
- Am I building units? -> build units
- Are my upgrades done? -> build upgrades
- Do I still have money? -> make more production (2 more factories and 1 starport)
- Do I still have money? -> make another CC and some turrets
- Am I 200/200? -> push outttt
Repeat this list over and over until the game ends or all of the conditions have been met. If you do this consistently (which will be hard at first due to how easy it is to float money), you can build a lot of units, have a lot of economy, and actually have enough production to replace lost units

# Different Matchup Variations
For various races, different compositions are needed so I will entail what they are here:
- For **terran** and **zerg**, going hellbat, tank, thor, viking is the move. This is an easy a move comp that can utilize strong siege tanks and army once you have a lot of supply.
- **Protoss** is a lot tougher because they have the immortal and carriers so try to make more thors hellbats and ghosts. Ghosts are hard to use as they are spellcasters but EMP is a spell u should use on protoss because it reduces shields (let me know if you have questions on how to use them)
  Build ghost academy at around 5th base against protoss.

# Scouting Cheeses
Not everyone is going to be as honest with the macro. So it is important not only to see if they are cheesing and how to react. Here are the cues for each of the races based on your scv scout
- **Terran**: No barracks in the main base (cheese)
- **Zerg**: There is no hatchery/the hatchery building is red and the spawning pool (green pool like thing) is already done
- **Protoss**: This one is a little tricky but if they don't build their natural base for a longgggg time (just have the scv patrol)

# Reacting to Cheese
Reactions will also differ based on cheeses so here is what to do when you see a race cheese

- **Terran**: Make the barracks into a reactor (no reaper), bunker close to the barracks/CC, and then a factory. Get the factory as soon as u get 100 gas and pump out marines in the bunker. Then get a CC and slowly try to come back to the build
- **Zerg**: Lift the barracks, build a bunker where the main wall is, factory then reactor, then make marines and tanks and siege the tanks a bit further from the main ramp
- **Protoss**: If they are cannon rushing you, send one scv to attack the probe, and 4 scvs to kill the pylon. Other than that, make a raven before a banshee then make marine tank like usual into hellbat thor ghost

Playing the game to have fun and learn: The number one thing that will prevent you from playing better is seeing the game from a winnning perspective. I know weird right? If you focus only on winning, you will never learn. You will keep thinking more about the losses and it will be less on the learning and fun and your mood will depend on your score. Take losses as an opportunity to learn more about the game and continue forward and just enjoy playing the game.

# Fighting
- At first sight of units, siege up tanks
- good to have 2 lines of tanks, one sieged, others not
- keep hellbats in front of thors and tanks
- make hellions, then transform into hellbats
- fight behind turrets if possible
- in front of natural is a great "contention zone" to keep tanks, stops army from building
- use orbital to scan on zerg creep for tumors
- keep tanks behind chokes, dont let them get surrounded
- against void rays, turn thors into high impact mode
