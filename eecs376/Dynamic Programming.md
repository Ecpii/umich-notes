**principle of optimality** - part of the optimal solution must be the optimal solution to a smaller part of the problem
ideally, the optimal solutions to the smaller problem plus *minimal* information from the bigger problem to be enough to find the optimal solution

The runtime of a bottom up dynamic programming approach is
$$
O(\text{\# of cells } \cdot \text{ time per cell})
$$
