Take some paired data where $X$ is some *predictor* or *explanatory variable* and $Y$ the *response*.

The regression model is defined as
$$
Y = m(X) + \varepsilon
$$
where $m(x)$ is a *regression function*, and $\varepsilon$ (error) is a random variable with expectation zero and finite variance.

$Y$ is always a random variable but $X$ can be either random or nonrandom.
